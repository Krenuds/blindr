üéØ PHASE COMPLETION MILESTONE

Completed phases:
{chr(10).join(f"‚úÖ {phase['name']} - {phase['completed_tasks']}/{phase['total_tasks']} tasks" for phase in completed_phases)}

This represents a major milestone in the BLINDR Discord AI voice bot
development. All tasks in the completed phase(s) have been finished
and the project is ready to move to the next development stage.
