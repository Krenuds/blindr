# Discord AI Bot - Development Roadmap

## üìã Development Philosophy
Build and test each component in isolation, then integrate step by step. Start with Discord interaction and work backwards through the pipeline.

- [ ] Test response generation

### Week 6-7: Simple Chat Loop
- [ ] Connect transcribed text to Ollama
- [ ] Generate responses with Llama 3.2
- [ ] Return text responses to Discord (text channel first)
- [ ] Test conversation flow

**Milestone**: Voice input generates AI text responses

---

## Phase 4: Text-to-Speech üîä
**Goal**: Complete the voice loop

### Week 7-8: Piper Setup
