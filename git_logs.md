fix: Resolve Whisper hallucination issues causing duplicate text

## Changes Made
‚úÖ Fixed duplicate prompt posting when hitting 30s hard cap
‚úÖ Added silence trimming to reduce Whisper hallucinations
‚úÖ Removed repetitive initial prompts that appeared in transcriptions
‚úÖ Improved prompt state management with finalizing flag

## Technical Details
- Added `user_prompt_finalizing` flag to prevent race conditions
- Implemented audio silence trimming (2% energy threshold)
- Simplified initial_prompt to avoid repetitive text in output
- Fixed variable reference error (audio_data -> audio_segment)

## Results
- No more duplicate Discord messages when prompts hit 30s limit
- Significantly reduced repetitive text patterns in transcriptions
- Cleaner, more natural transcription output

Tested with continuous voice input and verified improvements.

### 3. Commit: 7e6b3649

- **Author:** Claude Code

feat: Implement prompt mode for 30-second voice inputs üéôÔ∏è

## Major Changes
‚úÖ Added prompt mode configuration to Discord bot
‚úÖ Implemented 30-second hard cap for voice prompts
‚úÖ Extended silence timeout to 2 seconds for natural pauses
‚úÖ Accumulate transcriptions until prompt completion
‚úÖ Output combined prompt as [PROMPT X.Xs] format

## Technical Implementation
- Added prompt_mode, prompt_silence_timeout, prompt_max_duration configs
- Track prompt state with user_prompt_active/start/transcriptions
- Accumulate segments with üìù indicator
- Finalize prompts on silence timeout or hard cap
- Prevent multiple finalizations with state management

## Whisper Optimization
- Force English language detection to reduce hallucinations
- Add initial_prompt for better transcription context
- Maintain existing overlap buffer strategy

The bot now intelligently handles longer voice inputs up to 30 seconds,
perfect for complex prompts that will be sent to LLMs for processing.
