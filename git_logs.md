Update: Complete Whisper integration and enhance transcription features

âœ… WHISPER INTEGRATION ENHANCEMENT

## Core Updates:
âœ… Add WhisperClient class for seamless API communication
âœ… Integrate real-time transcription into Discord bot workflow
âœ… Update Whisper service to use 'small' model for better accuracy
âœ… Add dedicated \!transcribe command for manual transcription testing

## Bot Enhancements:
âœ… Automatic transcription during recording sessions
âœ… Real-time voice-to-text feedback in Discord channels
âœ… Enhanced status display with Phase 2 completion
âœ… Improved error handling and user feedback

## Documentation Updates:
âœ… Update ROADMAP.md to reflect Whisper model optimization completion
âœ… Refresh git logs with recent development history
âœ… Update phase tracking to show 44% completion on Phase 2
âœ… Streamline documentation checking hook for better clarity

## Technical Improvements:
- Discord bot now automatically transcribes recorded audio
- Users get immediate feedback on their voice input
- Whisper service upgraded from 'tiny' to 'small' model for RTX 2080
- Better error handling and logging throughout the pipeline

This completes the core voice-to-text integration, moving the project
significantly forward in Phase 2 development.

Design: Add streaming audio architecture plan using brodan approach

ðŸ“‹ STREAMING AUDIO DESIGN DOCUMENT

Created comprehensive design document for replacing manual recording
with continuous audio streaming, based on proven brodan repository approach.

## Key Design Decisions:
âœ… Use brodan's STTAudioSink with energy-based VAD instead of complex WebRTC VAD
âœ… Implement buffered streaming (3-second segments) to Whisper
âœ… Auto-join voice channels and start streaming immediately
âœ… Simple threshold-based silence filtering (energy_threshold: 50)

## Implementation Plan:
- Adapt brodan/src/audio_processor.py â†’ blindr/src/streaming_audio_sink.py
- Replace manual recording commands with continuous streaming
- Remove current audio_sinks.py manual recording infrastructure
- Add auto-join functionality from brodan's proven approach

## Benefits:
- Production-tested approach from working brodan implementation
- Simple energy-based VAD instead of complex detection algorithms
- Real-time transcription with 3-second buffered segments
- No manual user intervention required for continuous operation

This design provides a clear roadmap for implementing streaming audio
using a proven, efficient architecture that aligns with the simplified
approach of continuous streaming to Whisper without complex VAD.

### 4. Commit: 741ac46a

- **Author:** Claude Code

- **Subject:** Security: Remove Discord bot token and improve env file handling

**Full Commit Message:**
```
Security: Remove Discord bot token and improve env file handling

ðŸ”’ SECURITY ENHANCEMENT

## Security Fixes:
âœ… Remove .env file from git tracking to prevent token exposure
âœ… Add .env to .gitignore to prevent future accidental commits
âœ… Create .env.example template with placeholder values
âœ… Replace actual Discord bot token with placeholder in local .env

## Changes:
- .env file is now ignored by git (contains real secrets)
- .env.example provides template for new developers
- Updated .gitignore to include .env files

This resolves GitHub push protection issues and prevents future secret leaks.

### 5. Commit: 3cd2b1cc

- **Author:** Claude Code
- **Date:** 2025-07-25 20:04:37 -0400
- **Subject:** Clean up repository and update documentation

**Full Commit Message:**
```
Clean up repository and update documentation

ðŸ§¹ REPOSITORY CLEANUP & DOCUMENTATION UPDATE

## Repository Cleanup:
âœ… Remove entire venv/ directory from git tracking (thousands of files)
âœ… Remove all __pycache__ directories and .pyc files
âœ… Remove log files (logs/bot.log)
âœ… Add comprehensive .gitignore with Python, IDE, OS, and project-specific rules
âœ… Add .gitkeep to preserve recorded_audio directory structure

## Documentation Updates:
âœ… Update CLAUDE.md architecture diagram:
  - Changed Whisper from 'Docker Container' to 'Native Service'
  - Updated Discord Bot from 'discord.py' to 'py-cord with AudioSink'
  - Updated testing instruction from 'docker logs' to 'service logs'

âœ… Update ROADMAP.md Phase 2 status:
  - Mark Whisper deployment as complete (native service with GPU)
  - Mark REST API endpoint as complete (port 9000)
  - Mark basic testing as complete
  - Note current tiny model usage for optimization

## Impact:
- Repository size dramatically reduced (removed ~2000+ tracked files)
- Documentation now accurately reflects current mixed native/Docker architecture
- Proper gitignore prevents future accidental commits of temporary files
- Clean foundation for continued development
