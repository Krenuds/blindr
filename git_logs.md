fix: correct event loop error in prompt hard cap handling - UNTESTED

Fixed 'no running event loop' error when prompt duration exceeds max limit
by using asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe instead of asyncio.create_task
for cross-thread coroutine execution.

feat: implement prompt mode for continuous speech concatenation - UNTESTED

Restored the original prompt mode functionality that accumulates multiple speech
segments and combines them into a single message when the user stops speaking.

Key changes:
- Added prompt mode configuration with longer silence timeout (2.0s)
- Accumulate transcriptions in user_prompt_transcriptions list
- Only finalize prompts after prompt_silence_timeout of silence
- Separate segment processing from prompt finalization
- Track last speech time to determine when to finalize prompts

This allows continuous speech to be treated as a single input rather than
being broken into separate messages for each audio segment.

fix: prevent timeout rescheduling in TimeoutManager - UNTESTED

The TimeoutManager was cancelling existing timeouts when schedule_timeout
was called, defeating the purpose of the check in _handle_discord_vad_timeout.

Changed schedule_timeout to skip if a timeout is already active for the user,
preventing the race condition that was stopping transcriptions from processing.

fix: resolve timeout scheduling race condition in Discord VAD processing - TESTED âœ…

## Problem Identified
The audio streaming would start but never properly process speech segments due to a
timeout scheduling race condition. Timeouts were being scheduled on every Discord
audio packet instead of once per speech segment, preventing the timeout handlers
from ever executing and processing buffered audio for transcription.

## Root Cause
- Discord VAD sends audio packets continuously during speech
- Each packet triggered a new timeout schedule via `_handle_discord_vad_timeout()`
- Previous timeouts were cancelled and replaced before they could complete
- Result: Audio buffers accumulated but were never sent to Whisper for processing

## Solution Applied
1. **Single Timeout Per User**: Added check `if user_id not in self.timeout_manager.user_timeout_tasks:`
   - Prevents scheduling multiple concurrent timeouts for the same user
   - Allows timeout to complete its full duration and process the audio buffer

2. **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added detailed timeout lifecycle logging
   - Track timeout scheduling, sleep duration, and processing decisions
   - Helps identify timing issues in speech segmentation

## Testing Results
âœ… Audio streaming starts correctly
âœ… Timeouts now execute after speech segments end
âœ… Audio buffers are processed and sent to Whisper
âœ… No more hanging "started streaming" state

## Ready For
- End-to-end voice transcription testing with real speech input
- LLM integration phase with working audio â†’ text pipeline

fix: resolve audio processing errors in reorganized architecture - TESTED âœ…

## Audio Processing Fixes
Fixed critical runtime errors in the Discord audio interface after domain reorganization.

## Issues Resolved:
1. **User ID Extraction**: Fixed `'int' object has no attribute 'id'` error
   - Added proper handling: `user_id = user.id if hasattr(user, "id") else user`
   - Matches original Discord.py behavior

2. **Buffer Manager Integration**: Fixed method signature mismatches
   - Updated `add_audio_chunk()` calls to include `current_time` parameter
   - Fixed `_process_user_timeout()` to use `clear_user_buffer()` correctly

3. **Timeout Handler**: Implemented proper async timeout pattern
   - Added `_timeout_handler()` coroutine for speech segmentation
   - Maintains original timeout logic for VAD-based processing

4. **Import Dependencies**: Made Whisper service import optional
   - Bot can run in client-only mode when torch not available
   - Graceful degradation for development environments

## Testing Results:
âœ… Bot connects to Discord successfully
âœ… Joins voice channel without errors
âœ… Audio processing pipeline initializes correctly
âœ… No runtime errors in audio write operations

## Ready For:
- Voice transcription testing with Whisper service
- End-to-end audio â†’ transcription â†’ Discord workflow
