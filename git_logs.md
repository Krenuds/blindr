fix: Resolve Whisper hallucination issues causing duplicate text

## Changes Made
âœ… Fixed duplicate prompt posting when hitting 30s hard cap
âœ… Added silence trimming to reduce Whisper hallucinations
âœ… Removed repetitive initial prompts that appeared in transcriptions
âœ… Improved prompt state management with finalizing flag

## Technical Details

- Implemented audio silence trimming (2% energy threshold)
- Simplified initial_prompt to avoid repetitive text in output
- Fixed variable reference error (audio_data -> audio_segment)

## Results
- No more duplicate Discord messages when prompts hit 30s limit
- Significantly reduced repetitive text patterns in transcriptions
- Cleaner, more natural transcription output

Tested with continuous voice input and verified improvements.
