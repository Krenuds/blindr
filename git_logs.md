Add Documentation Checking Hook (PreToolUse)

🔍 DOCUMENTATION VALIDATION ENHANCEMENT

Added intelligent documentation checking to prevent Claude from making
assumptions about APIs and integrations. The system now automatically
reminds Claude to consult official documentation before implementing.

## What was added:

### PreToolUse Hook (.claude/check_documentation.py)
✅ Detects API/integration patterns in code being written
✅ Provides specific documentation suggestions based on detected libraries
✅ Non-blocking reminder system that encourages best practices
✅ Covers major technologies: Discord.py, FastAPI, Ollama, Whisper, etc.

### Smart Pattern Detection
- Discord.py → Official Discord.py docs and examples
- FastAPI → Official FastAPI documentation
- Ollama → Ollama API reference
- Whisper → OpenAI Whisper documentation
- Async patterns → Python asyncio docs
- And more...

### Hook Configuration Updated
- Added PreToolUse hook for Write < /dev/null | Edit|MultiEdit tools
- Integrates seamlessly with existing hook system
- Maintains all existing functionality

## Benefits:
- Prevents API assumptions and incorrect implementations
- Encourages consulting proven examples and official docs
- Improves code quality and reliability
- Reduces debugging time from incorrect API usage

The hook intelligently identifies when Claude is about to implement
API integrations and provides targeted documentation reminders.
