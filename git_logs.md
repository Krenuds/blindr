fix: Resolve Whisper hallucination issues causing duplicate text

## Changes Made
✅ Fixed duplicate prompt posting when hitting 30s hard cap
✅ Added silence trimming to reduce Whisper hallucinations
✅ Removed repetitive initial prompts that appeared in transcriptions
✅ Improved prompt state management with finalizing flag

## Technical Details
- Added `user_prompt_finalizing` flag to prevent race conditions
- Implemented audio silence trimming (2% energy threshold)
- Simplified initial_prompt to avoid repetitive text in output
- Fixed variable reference error (audio_data -> audio_segment)

## Results
- No more duplicate Discord messages when prompts hit 30s limit
- Significantly reduced repetitive text patterns in transcriptions
- Cleaner, more natural transcription output

Tested with continuous voice input and verified improvements.

### 2. Commit: 7e6b3649

- **Author:** Claude Code
- **Date:** 2025-07-25 23:05:39 -0400
- **Subject:** feat: Implement prompt mode for 30-second voice inputs 🎙️

**Full Commit Message:**
```
feat: Implement prompt mode for 30-second voice inputs 🎙️

## Major Changes
✅ Added prompt mode configuration to Discord bot
✅ Implemented 30-second hard cap for voice prompts
✅ Extended silence timeout to 2 seconds for natural pauses
✅ Accumulate transcriptions until prompt completion
✅ Output combined prompt as [PROMPT X.Xs] format

## Technical Implementation
- Added prompt_mode, prompt_silence_timeout, prompt_max_duration configs
- Track prompt state with user_prompt_active/start/transcriptions
- Accumulate segments with 📝 indicator
- Finalize prompts on silence timeout or hard cap
- Prevent multiple finalizations with state management

## Whisper Optimization
- Force English language detection to reduce hallucinations
- Add initial_prompt for better transcription context
- Maintain existing overlap buffer strategy

The bot now intelligently handles longer voice inputs up to 30 seconds,
perfect for complex prompts that will be sent to LLMs for processing.

Optimize: Implement overlap buffer strategy for seamless transcription 🎯

## Performance Tuning Improvements
✅ Increased buffer duration from 3.0s to 5.0s for better context
✅ Reduced silence timeout from 1.0s to 0.5s for faster response
✅ Reduced min speech duration from 0.5s to 0.3s to capture shorter utterances
✅ Added 0.5s overlap buffer to prevent speech cutoffs between segments

## Overlap Buffer Implementation
✅ Store last 0.5 seconds of audio from each processed buffer
✅ Prepend overlap to next buffer for continuity
✅ Implemented merge_transcriptions() to remove duplicate words at boundaries
✅ Track last transcription per user for intelligent merging

## Architecture Enhancements
✅ Added user_overlap_buffers dict to store overlap audio
✅ Added user_last_transcription dict for merge detection
✅ Calculate overlap samples based on duration and sample rate
✅ Clear overlap buffers on cleanup

## Test Results with Podcast Audio
🎤 Coherent conversation flow without mid-sentence cutoffs
📝 Complete thoughts captured in 5-second segments
🚀 Faster response with 0.5s silence detection
✨ Seamless transitions between buffer segments

Before: "The point is not the facts, it's the" [CUT]
After: "The point is not the facts, it's the procedure the scientific method"

The overlap buffer strategy successfully eliminates speech cutoffs
while maintaining low latency and high accuracy\!
