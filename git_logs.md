Phase 1: Automatic Voice Channel Integration

üîä VOICE CHANNEL CONNECTION COMPLETE

Implemented automatic voice channel joining functionality. Bot now
automatically connects to the "blindr" voice channel on startup and
maintains persistent connection with reconnection handling.

## What was implemented:

### Automatic Voice Connection (src/bot.py)
‚úÖ Auto-join voice channel on bot startup in on_ready event
‚úÖ Configurable channel name via VOICE_CHANNEL_NAME environment variable
‚úÖ Multi-guild voice channel discovery and connection
‚úÖ Voice client reference storage for future audio capture
‚úÖ Enhanced status command showing voice connection status

### Voice Connection Management
‚úÖ Voice state intents enabled for voice channel monitoring
‚úÖ Automatic reconnection on voice disconnection via on_voice_state_update
‚úÖ Error handling for missing channels and permission issues
‚úÖ Graceful shutdown handling for voice connections
‚úÖ Comprehensive logging for voice connection lifecycle

### Environment Configuration
‚úÖ Added VOICE_CHANNEL_NAME=blindr to .env and .env.example
‚úÖ Configurable voice channel name (defaults to "blindr")

## Testing Results:
- ‚úÖ Bot successfully connects to voice channel "blindr"
- ‚úÖ Voice handshake completes successfully
- ‚úÖ Connection persists and maintains presence in voice channel
- ‚úÖ Status command shows accurate voice connection status
- ‚úÖ Error handling functional for connection issues

## Phase 1 Progress: 10/10 tasks completed
‚úÖ Basic bot setup complete
‚úÖ Voice channel connection complete
Next: Phase 1 Week 2-3 - Audio capture with AudioSink implementation

Simplify UserPromptSubmit hook - Remove roadmap auto-injection

üßπ HOOK SYSTEM CLEANUP

Removed automatic roadmap progress injection from session startup.
Claude now receives only recent git history as context, making sessions
cleaner and more focused.

## Changes:
‚úÖ UserPromptSubmit hook now provides only git history context
‚úÖ Roadmap context removed from automatic injection
‚úÖ User manages their own input about what to work on
‚úÖ Claude focuses on updating roadmap progress as tasks complete

## Benefits:
- Cleaner session startup with relevant context only
- Less noise and information overload
- User-controlled development focus
- Claude still has roadmap_tracker.py available when needed

The hook system is now more focused and user-friendly while maintaining
all tracking capabilities.

Add Documentation Checking Hook (PreToolUse)

üîç DOCUMENTATION VALIDATION ENHANCEMENT

Added intelligent documentation checking to prevent Claude from making
assumptions about APIs and integrations. The system now automatically
reminds Claude to consult official documentation before implementing.

## What was added:

‚úÖ Detects API/integration patterns in code being written
‚úÖ Provides specific documentation suggestions based on detected libraries
‚úÖ Non-blocking reminder system that encourages best practices
‚úÖ Covers major technologies: Discord.py, FastAPI, Ollama, Whisper, etc.

### Smart Pattern Detection
- Discord.py ‚Üí Official Discord.py docs and examples
- FastAPI ‚Üí Official FastAPI documentation
- Ollama ‚Üí Ollama API reference
- Whisper ‚Üí OpenAI Whisper documentation
- Async patterns ‚Üí Python asyncio docs
- And more...

### Hook Configuration Updated
- Added PreToolUse hook for Write < /dev/null | Edit|MultiEdit tools
- Integrates seamlessly with existing hook system
- Maintains all existing functionality

## Benefits:
- Prevents API assumptions and incorrect implementations
- Encourages consulting proven examples and official docs
- Improves code quality and reliability
- Reduces debugging time from incorrect API usage

The hook intelligently identifies when Claude is about to implement
API integrations and provides targeted documentation reminders.
