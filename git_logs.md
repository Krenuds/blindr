feat: Implement prompt mode for 30-second voice inputs 🎙️

## Major Changes
✅ Added prompt mode configuration to Discord bot
✅ Implemented 30-second hard cap for voice prompts
✅ Extended silence timeout to 2 seconds for natural pauses
✅ Accumulate transcriptions until prompt completion
✅ Output combined prompt as [PROMPT X.Xs] format

## Technical Implementation
- Added prompt_mode, prompt_silence_timeout, prompt_max_duration configs
- Track prompt state with user_prompt_active/start/transcriptions
- Accumulate segments with 📝 indicator
- Finalize prompts on silence timeout or hard cap
- Prevent multiple finalizations with state management

## Whisper Optimization
- Force English language detection to reduce hallucinations
- Add initial_prompt for better transcription context
- Maintain existing overlap buffer strategy

The bot now intelligently handles longer voice inputs up to 30 seconds,
perfect for complex prompts that will be sent to LLMs for processing.

Optimize: Implement overlap buffer strategy for seamless transcription 🎯

## Performance Tuning Improvements
✅ Increased buffer duration from 3.0s to 5.0s for better context
✅ Reduced silence timeout from 1.0s to 0.5s for faster response
✅ Reduced min speech duration from 0.5s to 0.3s to capture shorter utterances
✅ Added 0.5s overlap buffer to prevent speech cutoffs between segments

## Overlap Buffer Implementation
✅ Store last 0.5 seconds of audio from each processed buffer
✅ Prepend overlap to next buffer for continuity
✅ Implemented merge_transcriptions() to remove duplicate words at boundaries
✅ Track last transcription per user for intelligent merging

## Architecture Enhancements
✅ Added user_overlap_buffers dict to store overlap audio
✅ Added user_last_transcription dict for merge detection
✅ Calculate overlap samples based on duration and sample rate
✅ Clear overlap buffers on cleanup

## Test Results with Podcast Audio
🎤 Coherent conversation flow without mid-sentence cutoffs
📝 Complete thoughts captured in 5-second segments
🚀 Faster response with 0.5s silence detection
✨ Seamless transitions between buffer segments

Before: "The point is not the facts, it's the" [CUT]
After: "The point is not the facts, it's the procedure the scientific method"

The overlap buffer strategy successfully eliminates speech cutoffs
while maintaining low latency and high accuracy\!

### 5. Commit: 004299ca

- **Author:** Claude Code
- **Date:** 2025-07-25 22:20:01 -0400
- **Subject:** Fix: Discord voice transcription pipeline now working\! 🎉

**Full Commit Message:**
```
Fix: Discord voice transcription pipeline now working\! 🎉

## Fixed Critical Threading Issue
✅ Implemented asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe for cross-thread communication
✅ Bot event loop now properly passed to StreamingAudioSink
✅ Audio processing runs in bot's event loop instead of Discord's thread

## Audio Format Fixes
✅ Added PCM to WAV conversion with proper headers
✅ Implemented 48kHz to 16kHz resampling for Whisper compatibility
✅ Mono audio properly formatted for transcription

## Simplified Architecture
✅ Removed complex async buffer management tasks
✅ Immediate processing when buffers fill or silence detected
✅ Proper locks prevent concurrent processing issues

## Enhanced Logging
✅ Added debug logging throughout the pipeline
✅ Speech detection logs with energy levels
✅ Whisper API request/response logging
✅ Clear success indicators (✅) in logs

## Test Results
🎤 Successfully transcribing continuous speech in real-time
📝 3-second buffered segments with silence detection
🚀 Low latency from speech to Discord text output
👥 Multi-user support with independent buffers

The system now successfully:
1. Receives audio from Discord users
2. Buffers with energy-based VAD
3. Processes through proper threading model
4. Converts and resamples audio correctly
5. Sends to Whisper and posts transcriptions

Phase 2 is now TRULY complete and working\!
