Design: Add streaming audio architecture plan using brodan approach

📋 STREAMING AUDIO DESIGN DOCUMENT

Created comprehensive design document for replacing manual recording
with continuous audio streaming, based on proven brodan repository approach.

## Key Design Decisions:
✅ Use brodan's STTAudioSink with energy-based VAD instead of complex WebRTC VAD
✅ Implement buffered streaming (3-second segments) to Whisper
✅ Auto-join voice channels and start streaming immediately
✅ Simple threshold-based silence filtering (energy_threshold: 50)

## Implementation Plan:
- Adapt brodan/src/audio_processor.py → blindr/src/streaming_audio_sink.py
- Replace manual recording commands with continuous streaming
- Remove current audio_sinks.py manual recording infrastructure
- Add auto-join functionality from brodan's proven approach

## Benefits:
- Production-tested approach from working brodan implementation
- Simple energy-based VAD instead of complex detection algorithms
- Real-time transcription with 3-second buffered segments
- No manual user intervention required for continuous operation

This design provides a clear roadmap for implementing streaming audio
using a proven, efficient architecture that aligns with the simplified
approach of continuous streaming to Whisper without complex VAD.

Security: Remove Discord bot token and improve env file handling

🔒 SECURITY ENHANCEMENT

## Security Fixes:
✅ Remove .env file from git tracking to prevent token exposure
✅ Add .env to .gitignore to prevent future accidental commits
✅ Create .env.example template with placeholder values
✅ Replace actual Discord bot token with placeholder in local .env

## Changes:
- .env file is now ignored by git (contains real secrets)
- .env.example provides template for new developers
- Updated .gitignore to include .env files

This resolves GitHub push protection issues and prevents future secret leaks.

Clean up repository and update documentation

🧹 REPOSITORY CLEANUP & DOCUMENTATION UPDATE

## Repository Cleanup:
✅ Remove entire venv/ directory from git tracking (thousands of files)
✅ Remove all __pycache__ directories and .pyc files
✅ Remove log files (logs/bot.log)
✅ Add comprehensive .gitignore with Python, IDE, OS, and project-specific rules
✅ Add .gitkeep to preserve recorded_audio directory structure

## Documentation Updates:
✅ Update CLAUDE.md architecture diagram:
  - Changed Whisper from 'Docker Container' to 'Native Service'
  - Updated Discord Bot from 'discord.py' to 'py-cord with AudioSink'
  - Updated testing instruction from 'docker logs' to 'service logs'

✅ Update ROADMAP.md Phase 2 status:
  - Mark Whisper deployment as complete (native service with GPU)
  - Mark REST API endpoint as complete (port 9000)
  - Mark basic testing as complete
  - Note current tiny model usage for optimization

## Impact:
- Repository size dramatically reduced (removed ~2000+ tracked files)
- Documentation now accurately reflects current mixed native/Docker architecture
- Proper gitignore prevents future accidental commits of temporary files
- Clean foundation for continued development
