feat: Improve clear commands with bulk delete and add clearall

- Update help text to include both clear commands

fix: Resolve Whisper hallucination issues causing duplicate text

## Changes Made
✅ Fixed duplicate prompt posting when hitting 30s hard cap
✅ Added silence trimming to reduce Whisper hallucinations
✅ Removed repetitive initial prompts that appeared in transcriptions
✅ Improved prompt state management with finalizing flag

## Technical Details
- Added `user_prompt_finalizing` flag to prevent race conditions
- Implemented audio silence trimming (2% energy threshold)
- Simplified initial_prompt to avoid repetitive text in output
- Fixed variable reference error (audio_data -> audio_segment)

## Results
- No more duplicate Discord messages when prompts hit 30s limit
- Significantly reduced repetitive text patterns in transcriptions
- Cleaner, more natural transcription output

Tested with continuous voice input and verified improvements.

### 5. Commit: 7e6b3649

- **Author:** Claude Code
- **Date:** 2025-07-25 23:05:39 -0400
- **Subject:** feat: Implement prompt mode for 30-second voice inputs 🎙️

**Full Commit Message:**
```
feat: Implement prompt mode for 30-second voice inputs 🎙️

## Major Changes
✅ Added prompt mode configuration to Discord bot
✅ Implemented 30-second hard cap for voice prompts
✅ Extended silence timeout to 2 seconds for natural pauses
✅ Accumulate transcriptions until prompt completion
✅ Output combined prompt as [PROMPT X.Xs] format

## Technical Implementation
- Added prompt_mode, prompt_silence_timeout, prompt_max_duration configs
- Track prompt state with user_prompt_active/start/transcriptions
- Accumulate segments with 📝 indicator
- Finalize prompts on silence timeout or hard cap
- Prevent multiple finalizations with state management

## Whisper Optimization
- Force English language detection to reduce hallucinations
- Add initial_prompt for better transcription context
- Maintain existing overlap buffer strategy

The bot now intelligently handles longer voice inputs up to 30 seconds,
perfect for complex prompts that will be sent to LLMs for processing.
