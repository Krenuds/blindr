fix: prevent timeout rescheduling in TimeoutManager - UNTESTED

The TimeoutManager was cancelling existing timeouts when schedule_timeout
was called, defeating the purpose of the check in _handle_discord_vad_timeout.

Changed schedule_timeout to skip if a timeout is already active for the user,
preventing the race condition that was stopping transcriptions from processing.

fix: resolve timeout scheduling race condition in Discord VAD processing - TESTED âœ…

## Problem Identified
The audio streaming would start but never properly process speech segments due to a
timeout scheduling race condition. Timeouts were being scheduled on every Discord
audio packet instead of once per speech segment, preventing the timeout handlers
from ever executing and processing buffered audio for transcription.

## Root Cause
- Discord VAD sends audio packets continuously during speech
- Each packet triggered a new timeout schedule via `_handle_discord_vad_timeout()`
- Previous timeouts were cancelled and replaced before they could complete
- Result: Audio buffers accumulated but were never sent to Whisper for processing

## Solution Applied
1. **Single Timeout Per User**: Added check `if user_id not in self.timeout_manager.user_timeout_tasks:`
   - Prevents scheduling multiple concurrent timeouts for the same user
   - Allows timeout to complete its full duration and process the audio buffer

2. **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added detailed timeout lifecycle logging
   - Track timeout scheduling, sleep duration, and processing decisions
   - Helps identify timing issues in speech segmentation

## Testing Results
âœ… Audio streaming starts correctly
âœ… Timeouts now execute after speech segments end
âœ… Audio buffers are processed and sent to Whisper
âœ… No more hanging "started streaming" state

## Ready For
- End-to-end voice transcription testing with real speech input
- LLM integration phase with working audio â†’ text pipeline

fix: resolve audio processing errors in reorganized architecture - TESTED âœ…

## Audio Processing Fixes
Fixed critical runtime errors in the Discord audio interface after domain reorganization.

## Issues Resolved:
1. **User ID Extraction**: Fixed `'int' object has no attribute 'id'` error
   - Added proper handling: `user_id = user.id if hasattr(user, "id") else user`
   - Matches original Discord.py behavior

2. **Buffer Manager Integration**: Fixed method signature mismatches
   - Updated `add_audio_chunk()` calls to include `current_time` parameter
   - Fixed `_process_user_timeout()` to use `clear_user_buffer()` correctly

3. **Timeout Handler**: Implemented proper async timeout pattern
   - Added `_timeout_handler()` coroutine for speech segmentation
   - Maintains original timeout logic for VAD-based processing

4. **Import Dependencies**: Made Whisper service import optional
   - Bot can run in client-only mode when torch not available
   - Graceful degradation for development environments

## Testing Results:
âœ… Bot connects to Discord successfully
âœ… Joins voice channel without errors
âœ… Audio processing pipeline initializes correctly
âœ… No runtime errors in audio write operations

## Ready For:
- Voice transcription testing with Whisper service
- End-to-end audio â†’ transcription â†’ Discord workflow

### 4. Commit: 2028b8fa

- **Author:** Claude Code
- **Date:** 2025-07-26 14:03:12 -0400
- **Subject:** refactor: reorganize into audio-centric domain architecture - UNTESTED

**Full Commit Message:**
```
refactor: reorganize into audio-centric domain architecture - UNTESTED

## Domain Reorganization Complete
Successfully inverted the architecture to make audio processing the core domain
instead of Discord being central. This creates a cleaner, more extensible structure.

## New Architecture:
- **Audio Domain**: Core audio processing (AudioProcessor, BufferManager, TimeoutManager)
- **Discord Interface**: Lightweight wrapper around audio core (DiscordAudioSink)
- **Bot Package**: Pure Discord I/O, commands, and channel management

## Changes Made:
1. **Created `src/audio/` package** - Core audio processing domain
   - `streaming_sink.py` - Pure audio processing components
   - `discord_interface.py` - Discord-specific audio capture

2. **Simplified `src/bot/voice_bot.py`** - Now uses audio domain
   - Removed audio processing logic
   - Clean import from audio domain
   - Focus on Discord ceremony only

3. **Removed `src/bot/audio_processing.py`** - Moved to audio domain

## Benefits:
- **Reusable Core**: Audio processing independent of Discord
- **Clean Separation**: Discord is just one interface to audio core
- **Extensible**: Easy to add web interface, mobile app, API endpoints
- **Maintainable**: Clear domain boundaries

## Ready For:
- LLM integration can now coordinate audio â†’ Whisper â†’ classification â†’ model routing
- Additional interfaces (web, mobile) can reuse the same audio core
- Microservices architecture when needed
